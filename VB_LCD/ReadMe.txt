A few quick things:

  1. This program is utterly useless unless you have an
     HD44780 (or compatible) LCD Display.
  2. It only works for Parallel LCD's.
  3. You MUST have your LCD wired correctly for it to function.
  4. This program WORKS. If your LCD won't, check your wiring.
  5. This program was written for a 20x4 Display. Any other
     display will not work correctly with this code. However,
     the code is easily modified.
  6. If your an idiot, dont even try using this code.


Notes:

   A required file, Win95io.dll, should be in the same directory
   as the code (or in "C:\windows\system"). PSC would not allow
   me to upload it. But you can download it at:
   http://www.geocities.com/mrfluffyguy/Win95io.zip

   The file LCD.gif is the wiring schematic for 14 or 16 pin
   HD44780 (or compatible) LCD's. If your display has NO
   backlight, ignore pins 15 and 16.

   The file lcd-ch1a.gif is the character set for a HD44780
   (or compatible) LCD module.
